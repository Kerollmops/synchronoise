# synchronoise

fun synchronization primitives for your fun synchronization needs

This is a collection of synchronization facilities that aren't part of the standard library that I
wanted to make sure were available for the Rust community. Right now it's just a port of
CountdownEvent and EventWaitHandle (AutoResetEvent/ManualResetEvent) from .NET, but it could be
expanded in the future.
